# Automated Deployment Guide

## ✅ Railway: Complete CLI Automation (RECOMMENDED)

Railway provides **100% command-line automation** - no web interface required!

### Prerequisites

- Node.js/npm installed
- GitHub account (already connected)
- Railway account (create at https://railway.app)

### One-Time Setup (2 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Install Railway CLI
npm i -g @railway/cli

# 2. Login to Railway (opens browser once)
railway login
```

### Deploy Your App (ONE COMMAND!)

```bash
# From your project directory
cd D:\vault_audit_redone

# Deploy everything automatically
railway up

# Railway will:
# ✅ Auto-detect Python/Flask
# ✅ Install all dependencies from requirements.txt
# ✅ Configure the server
# ✅ Set up persistent storage
# ✅ Deploy your app
# ✅ Give you a live URL
```

### Get Your App URL

```bash
# Generate a public domain
railway domain

# Opens your deployed app in browser
railway open

# View live logs
railway logs
```

### Automated GitHub Deployments

```bash
# Link to GitHub (auto-deploys on push)
railway link

# Now every git push deploys automatically!
git push origin master
# Railway auto-deploys in ~30 seconds
```

### Environment Variables (if needed)

```bash
# Set variables via CLI
railway variables set FLASK_ENV=production
railway variables set SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key

# Or use .env file (Railway auto-loads it)
```

### Complete Automation Script

Save this as `deploy.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Automated deployment script

echo "🚀 Starting automated deployment..."

# Install Railway CLI if not installed
if ! command -v railway &> /dev/null; then
    echo "📦 Installing Railway CLI..."
    npm i -g @railway/cli
fi

# Login check
echo "🔐 Checking Railway authentication..."
railway whoami || railway login

# Deploy
echo "🚀 Deploying application..."
railway up

# Get domain
echo "🌐 Getting deployment URL..."
railway domain

# View logs
echo "📋 Showing deployment logs..."
railway logs --tail 50

echo "✅ Deployment complete!"
```

Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

## Alternative: Render (Also Full Automation)

Render also supports CLI automation:

```bash
# Install Render CLI
brew install render  # Mac
# or download from https://render.com/docs/cli

# Login
render login

# Deploy from GitHub
render services create
# Follow prompts to select your repo
```
